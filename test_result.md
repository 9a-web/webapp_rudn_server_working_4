# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

## frontend:

##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

This prevents React app from loading entirely. ANALYSIS OF CODE IMPLEMENTATION: ✅ i18n configuration appears correct in /app/frontend/src/i18n/config.js with proper Russian/English translations ✅ MenuModal.jsx implements language switching with toggleLanguage() function that changes i18n.language between 'ru' and 'en' ✅ Language button shows current language (RU/EN) and is enabled (disabled: false) ✅ Translation files contain all required UI text mappings ✅ index.js imports i18n config before App ✅ Backend URL correctly set to http://localhost:8001 in .env file. CRITICAL ISSUE: Browser automation tool URL routing malfunction prevents verification of actual functionality. React app shows only 404 error from backend instead of loading frontend. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent must investigate and fix browser automation URL routing issue before language switching can be properly tested."

Now groups classes by time slot (e.g., 10:30-11:50). Frontend (App.js): Modified trackScheduleView() to count unique time slots using Set data structure. Calculates uniqueTimeSlots.size and passes as classes_count in metadata. Backend (achievements.py): Updated view_schedule action handler to accept classes_count from metadata and increment schedule_views by that amount (defaults to 1 for backwards compatibility). Example: If 3 subjects occur at 10:30-11:50, counts as 1 class instead of 3. Backend auto-reloaded. Ready for testing."

          comment: "✅ Analytics counting fix successfully verified. Created comprehensive test with telegram_id 999888777: 1) Created test user and got initial stats (schedule_views: 0) 2) Simulated viewing schedule with 5 classes - correctly incremented by 5 (schedule_views: 5) 3) Simulated viewing schedule with 3 classes - correctly incremented by 3 more (schedule_views: 8) 4) Tested backwards compatibility without metadata - correctly incremented by 1 (schedule_views: 9). Backend properly accepts classes_count from metadata and increments schedule_views by that amount instead of always by 1. Defaults to 1 when no metadata provided. All test scenarios passed - the fix is working correctly."

Fixed calculateScheduleStats() function to group classes by unique time slots instead of counting all disciplines separately. Now uses Set to track uniqueTimeSlots and counts schedule.length becomes uniqueTimeSlots.size. Updated classesByDay grouping to track unique times per day using Set structure. Creates arrays with one element per unique time slot for display. Example: 3 subjects at 10:30-11:50 now counts as 1 class instead of 3 in all analytics (total classes, hours, average per day, week chart). Frontend hot-reloaded. Ready for testing."

      message: "❌ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: Language switching functionality is NOT working. The language switcher button is completely missing from the Header component. Detailed investigation revealed: 1) Header only renders 1 button (calendar) instead of 2 buttons (language switcher + calendar) 2) Actual rendered HTML structure doesn't match the Header.jsx source code 3) Missing 'Right side' div container that should wrap both buttons 4) i18n libraries not loaded in browser (React and i18next not detected) 5) Header title shows hardcoded 'Rudn Schedule' instead of using translation function 6) Multiple rebuild attempts, cache clearing, and frontend restarts did not resolve the issue. ROOT CAUSE: The updated Header.jsx component with i18n integration is not being compiled or served correctly. The app appears to be serving an older version of the Header component without the language switcher implementation.

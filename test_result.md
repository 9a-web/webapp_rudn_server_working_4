# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      message: "✅ NOTIFICATION ENDPOINTS TESTING COMPLETED: Successfully tested notification settings endpoints as requested. All tests passed with telegram_id 123456789. ✅ GET /api/user-settings/{telegram_id}/notifications - Returns proper JSON with notifications_enabled, notification_time, telegram_id. Correctly handles 404 for non-existent users. Default settings: notifications_enabled=false, notification_time=10. ✅ PUT /api/user-settings/{telegram_id}/notifications - Successfully updates settings with both test payloads (enable with time=15, disable with time=10). Validates time range 5-30 and rejects invalid values with HTTP 422. Settings persist correctly. ✅ Edge cases handled: Invalid notification_time values (4, 31) properly rejected, non-existent users return 404. Backend service required dependency fixes (multidict, attrs, yarl, aiohappyeyeballs, aiosignal, httpx, tzlocal) but is now running successfully on localhost:8001."

      message: "🔧 BUG FIX: Notification Settings Modal Not Closing After Save. User reported that notification settings were saving correctly but modal window was not closing. Root cause identified: onClose callback was inside setTimeout but setSaving(false) was in finally block causing state management conflict. Fixed by moving setSaving(false) inside try/catch blocks before setTimeout and removing finally block. Modal now properly closes 300ms after successful save, giving time for success message to display. Backend notification endpoints tested and confirmed working (GET and PUT /api/user-settings/{telegram_id}/notifications). Frontend compiled successfully and restarted. Ready for UI testing to confirm fix."

      message: "🎨 UI UPDATE: Status Text Color Fixed. User reported that status text was displaying in black color instead of the correct status colors. Changed status text color from static #3B3B3B (dark gray) to dynamic color variable that matches the status: Закончилась displays in #76EF83 (green), В процессе displays in #FFC83F (yellow), Предстоит displays in #FF6B6B (red). This makes the status more visually distinctive and easier to read at a glance. Modified LiveScheduleSection.jsx line 238 to use color variable instead of hardcoded color. Frontend compiled successfully and restarted."

      message: "🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIX: Network Error / CORS Issue Resolved. User reported 'Ошибка сети. Проверьте подключение к интернету' error. Root cause: 1) Backend was not starting due to missing Python dependencies (attrs, aiohappyeyeballs, aiosignal, frozenlist, propcache, yarl). 2) CORS error when production frontend tried to access backend on different domain (https://class-progress-1.preview.emergentagent.com from https://project-analyzer-50.preview.emergentagent.com). Solution: 1) Installed all missing Python dependencies and added them to requirements.txt. 2) Updated /app/frontend/src/services/api.js to automatically detect environment: uses http://localhost:8001 for local development, uses window.location.origin for production (same domain, no CORS). 3) Added debug logging to track which backend URL is being used. Backend restarted successfully on port 8001. Frontend hot-reloaded changes. App now loads successfully with faculties list visible. User confirmed: 'Всё работает!' ✅"

      message: "🎨 UI IMPROVEMENT: Rounded Progress Bar Edges. User requested: 'Сделай закругление краёв основного progress bar во время того, как идёт пара'. Added strokeLinecap='round' attribute to the background circle in LiveScheduleCard.jsx (line 236). The progress circle already had rounded caps. Now both circles (background and progress) have smooth, rounded edges for a more polished visual appearance. Frontend compiled successfully. Changes applied via hot reload."

      message: "✨ FEATURE: Russian Word Pluralization for Minutes. User requested: 'Склоняй слово минут правильно'. Created new utility /app/frontend/src/utils/pluralize.js with pluralization functions for Russian language. Implements correct declension rules: 1 минута, 2-4 минуты, 5+ минут, 11-14 минут (exception). Updated LiveScheduleCard.jsx to use pluralizeMinutes() function instead of hardcoded 'минут'. Updated NotificationSettings.jsx for time options labels and success message. Now displays correct forms: '1 минута', '2 минуты', '5 минут', '21 минута', '22 минуты', etc. Tested all cases including exceptions (11-14). Frontend compiled successfully."
